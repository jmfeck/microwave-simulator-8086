# Microwave Simulator 8086

**Note:** This project was developed in 2016 as part of a university course assignment. It is being archived here for historical and portfolio purposes.

> âš¡ Important: The project documentation (manuals) and source code comments are written in Portuguese.

## Project Description

This project simulates a microwave timer using Assembly language for the Intel 8086 architecture.  
It was developed using the **Emu8086** emulator, which provides a simple graphical interface to simulate user interactions like buttons and LEDs.

The user manual explains how an end-user would operate the simulated microwave, while the technical manual describes the internal logic and structure of the Assembly program.

## Structure

- `src/` - Contains the Assembly source code (`Microondas8086.asm`).
- `manual-tecnico/` - Contains the technical documentation explaining the project implementation (in Portuguese).
- `manual-usuario/` - Contains the user manual, explaining how to use the microwave simulation (in Portuguese).

## How to Build and Run

1. Open the project with **Emu8086**.
2. Assemble and run the program within the emulator.

Alternatively, you can manually assemble it using tools like TASM + TLINK if you prefer a DOS environment.

## Requirements

- Emu8086 (preferred) or
- TASM / MASM + TLINK + DOS emulator (e.g., DOSBox)
